# Senior-Final-Project
Repo for final project - UniApp Project

## Description
This application I made for my Advanced Web Development course so
that I could learn and use MERN full stack technologies. The project uses React, Node, Express and MongoDB and it is question-and-answer website for college students to use. Currently the application allows you to create, view, edit, and delete questions. Addition features I need to implement, for example being able to answer or up vote a question. 

## To Run Application
